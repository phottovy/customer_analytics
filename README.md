## Background
***
In today’s business world, anticipating the needs and wants of your customers is vital to the success of your business. Partnering with
ClickFox, the leader in “[Customer Journey Analytics][2],” I was able to gain valuable real-world experience using advanced analytics working with
customer data on a current business use case.

For a particular client, ClickFox provides forecasts for daily, aggregated KPI’s related to key segments of the customer journey. The goal of this project is to both analyze the current process and look for ways to optimize the flow of information going forward.

## Data
***
The datasets consist of a number of separate daily feeds containing different customer metrics. For each feed, six different predictions using various time series methods are included. In addition, each daily forecast contains predictions for 14 days into the future. I was provided 10 months of raw data and actuals for these feeds to use for my analysis.
